<br/><br/>
- after that it will ask u about your username and password of hackerrank, <br/><br/>
- insert credentials(Pay attention if u insert your credentials correctly,  ```python start.py```),<br/><br/>
don't worry, because u can actually check my code i won't send these credentials anywhere<br/>
after all these steps program starts working(it takes nearly 23 minutes on my laptop with 16gb ram, processor intel i7)
don't close chrome window during this operation, also u can do everything u need during this operation</br></br>
- after all u will see file scripts.py and merged_output.py in the same directory as start.py
